# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

1 This is a React project have used vite to setup this React project(I have used vite beacasue it is faster)

2 If you haven't downloaded node modules then you should run npm i or npm install in the terminal

3 In terminal you have to run npm run dev

4 I have used tailwind css to style the components

5 I have used react-redux to manage my states

6 I have used fake store api to fetch data from it

     I hope you will like my project
     Thank you
